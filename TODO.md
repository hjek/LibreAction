# TODOs
- Verify submitted emails
- Deal with duplicate emails (Replace signup form entry on re-signup from same email address?)
- Show nearest actions / location selector
- CSS / styling
- Easy-to-use documentation
- Buddy pair-up
- SMS text message confirmation
- Easy action creation form
- Action expiry date / deadline. Filter by deadline.
- Post-signup page (e.g. show similar actions, or something)
- Maybe location and deadline should be optional? (global actions with no time limit)
- Automatically load real actions when they're there. Otherwise load examples.

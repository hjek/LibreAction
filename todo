Issue with mailto:
   Note that some headers are inherently unsafe to include in a message
   generated from a URL. For example, headers such as "From:", "Bcc:",
   and so on, should never be interpreted from a URL. In general, the
   fewer headers interpreted from the URL, the less likely it is that a
   sending agent will create an unsafe message.
